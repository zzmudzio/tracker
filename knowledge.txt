mvn clean package - removes current content of target/ directory and put a new artifact and other files as the result of build process
mvn clean install -> mvn clean package + install artifact as dependency in local .m2 repository, so it can be imported and used

@MockitoSpyBean - it can be useful if we want only partially mock given dependency. We can spy on that dependency, to check e.g.
whether given method has been called etc. 

@MockitoBean -> new and faster way of mocking beans, for example when we test service layer and want to mock repository.

=== Profiles === 

We can have for example application.properties, application-dev.properties, application-prod.properties 

It is a convenient way to for example connect to given postgresql db only when being on production, or to 
use h2 in memory database while developing. 

It can be set for example in Intellij in Run > Edit configurations by adding VM option: -Dspring.profiles.active=dev

In above example "dev" profile will be the active one. 

@Profile - it says that given bean should be active only while using given profile. 

@ActiveProfiles - activates a specific profile when running a test, e. g. @ActiveProfiles("dev") while running a test will do the same thing
as -Dspring.profiles.active=dev
